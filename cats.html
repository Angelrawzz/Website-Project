    <h1>All about my Cats</h1>
    <p>We never thought we'd have cats, let alone 3 of them. It all started when we went to find a cat for my Nana.
        <br>
        When we went to collect the cat she chose online we couldn't help but adopt 2 others: Whiskers and Tigger. Since they've been part of the family.
        <br>
        A couple years later we adopted Ollie after thinking she was a stray in fact one of the neighbours just didn't feed her, so now she's ours.
